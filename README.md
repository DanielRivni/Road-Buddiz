# Road-Buddiz Application
## **Introduction**
We've developed an app to assist people stuck on the road who are unable to resolve their vehicle issues. The app connects these individuals with nearby volunteers willing to provide on-the-spot help, ensuring quick and accessible assistance when it's needed most.

## **Installation**
Before running the code, ensure that the following libraries are pre-installed:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for running your project.
- **Npm**: Node.js package manager to install and manage dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
